# 🚀 Advanced DevOps Project: Jenkins + Terraform + Docker + ECS Fargate (Blue-Green Deployment)

This project demonstrates an end-to-end DevOps pipeline for deploying a containerized Flask application on AWS ECS Fargate using Blue-Green deployments via CodeDeploy.
It integrates Terraform for infrastructure as code, Jenkins for CI/CD automation, and Docker for containerization, ensuring zero-downtime deployments and multi-environment support.


# ⚙️ Features

CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins):

Build & test Flask app

Build & push Docker image to AWS ECR

Trigger Terraform to provision/update infrastructure

Deploy new version via ECS Blue-Green strategy

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):

VPC, Subnets, ALB

ECS Cluster + Services (Fargate)

CodeDeploy with Blue-Green traffic shifting

Blue-Green Deployment:

Deploy a new version ("green") alongside the old one ("blue")

Gradually shift traffic using ALB + CodeDeploy

Rollback automatically on failure

Dockerized Application:

Flask-based microservice

Runs in ECS Fargate

# 🚀 Deployment Flow

Developer commits code → GitHub

Jenkins Pipeline runs:

Build → Docker → ECR → Terraform → ECS → CodeDeploy

CodeDeploy performs Blue-Green Deployment

ALB shifts traffic between old and new tasks

✅ Zero Downtime Deployment
